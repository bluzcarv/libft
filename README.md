# LIBFT
*Project in C language part of 42 course (https://www.42sp.org.br/)*

###### In this project, we program our first C library. 

> In this repo, you will find all the codes developed during the libft project (Mandatory part + bonus). Many functions here reproduce existing functions, the objective of this project is to understand deeply how each function works by creating one-by-one from scratch.
